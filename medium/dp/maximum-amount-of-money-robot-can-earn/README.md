The grid contains a value coins[i][j] in each cell:


	If coins[i][j] &gt;= 0, the robot gains that many coins.
	If coins[i][j] &lt; 0, the robot encounters a robber, and the robber steals the absolute value of coins[i][j] coins.


The robot has a special ability to neutralize robbers in at most 2 cells on its path, preventing them from stealing coins in those cells.

Note: The robot&#39;s total coins can be negative.

Return the maximum profit the robot can gain on the route.
